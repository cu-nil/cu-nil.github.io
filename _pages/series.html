<div class="font-ibmserif text-sm mt-2 mb-8 space-y-6 mx-8 skew-1">
    <p><span class="italic">On Method</span> book series from Columbia University Press publishes concise, provocative reflections
    on the process of doing research in the humanities. From close reading to curatorial practice:
    critical making, mapping, walking, computing, annotating, visualizing, collecting, or
    experimenting — on the street, in the lab, or in the archives — the series presents advanced field
    practitioners in dialogue with their materials, tools, and techniques.</p>

    <p>The editorial collective <span class="font-bold uppercase">seeks proposals</span> for book projects of 45,000–75,000 words, which
    articulate a single method: explain its history, its possibilities, and limitations. We would
    like for our volumes to inspire novice readers as well as to challenge accepted orthodoxies,
    addressing a wide audience across disciplines, and representing a rich variety of perspectives
    from authors who write with passion about their craft.</p>
