The Narrative Intelligence Lab at Columbia University is a research collective dedicated to
exploring the mechanics of storytelling, influence, and collective thought in the digital age.
Situated at the intersection of literary studies, media theory, and computational analysis,
we investigate how narratives shape public discourse, reinforce or challenge ideological
structures, and evolve across networks. Our work spans disinformation ecosystems, the history
and future of propaganda, emergent storytelling in AI and social media, and the role of
literature in an era of algorithmic culture. By combining traditional humanities scholarship
with data-driven methodologies, we seek to understand not only how narratives move through
societies but how they encode power, agency, and resistance in an increasingly mediated world.
