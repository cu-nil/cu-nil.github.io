**Re: CUNIL lab funding**

The Narrative Intelligence Lab draws from Columbia's expertise in literary theory,
sociology, linguistics, and computation to study how stories shape our personal and shared
beliefs. Founded in 2025, the group is led by Dennis Yi Tenen, Associate Professor of English
and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.

A partnership with Incite Institute would help jump-start the lab's research activities, with
an emphasis on three related areas:

1. Collective cognition: thinking, writing, and creating in groups.

2. Influence (text reuse, plagiarism in the age of AI, schematic and otherwise algorithmic
modes of cultural/epistemic production).

3. Group thought and communal storytelling including expert discourse, conspiracy theory,
disinformation, and propaganda.

The "laboratory" aspect of the group's work indicates (a) a concerted effort to move beyond the
single authorship model in the humanities, and (b) a preference for mixed methods, combining
qualitative and quantitative modalities.

To achieve these goals, the lab actively seeks to promote targeted collaboration between
faculty, also involving graduate and undergraduate researchers, toward specific publishable
outcomes.

We recognize also that a significant barrier to collaboration lies in the lack of formal
training in qualitative and quantitative methods in the humanities. Consequently, we believe
an effective use of funding to lie in the training opportunities for scholars (at all stages
of their career). An example of such an opportunity involves a summer program in mixed methods
at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, Korea (Sam Oh, Communications) in partnership with
Harvard (Martin Puchner, English) and University of Toronto (Javed Mustafa, Communications),
with a pilot slated for the Summer of 2025.
