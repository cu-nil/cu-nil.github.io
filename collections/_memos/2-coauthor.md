The following articulates a set of guidelines for determining author order, assigning roles,
setting clear expectations, and crediting fairly in a varied collaborative environment.
These guidelines were written (a) in consultation with several similar labs, (b) in review of
relevant literature<sup>1-4</sup>, and (c) in light of existing standards<sup>5-6</sup>.

It is important to discuss authorship attribution early and throughout the project.<sup>5</sup>
Each repository will generally contain a `CRedIT.md` file, capturing a snapshot of that
conversation. Though assigned formally, we expect roles to occasionally change and evolve
throughout a project's lifecycle.

We recommend for the contents of the CRedIT.md log to be narrativized concisely inclusion in
the "attribution footnote," at the time of the publication.

## First, Second, Middle, Last (FSML) Author Emphasis Model

*First*, *Second*, *Middle*, and *Last* authors play distinct but dynamic roles as part of a
research team. In case of multiples, "bin" to role, but keep it reasonable: One first, second,
and last author is always preferable for clarity.

***First author/s*** tend to do the most work as well as being responsible, especially for
project conceptualization and methodology.

***Second author/s*** tend to make deep contributions in several specific areas of
responsibility.

***Middle author/s*** usually play significant supporting roles.

***Last author/s*** usually involve more senior scholars, who write, supervise, fund,
administrate, and place, contributing meaningfully also to selected areas of deep expertise.

Ad-hoc contributions not rising to the level of authorship can be credited in the attribution
footnote.

## Considerations

- Facilitate clear ownership of specific tasks.
- The lab's GitHub project template includes a CREDIT file that should be updated regularly.
- Using logged tools such as as GitHub and Google Docs helps keep the contributions transparent.
Try to always capture your offline work in the form of memos or logs committed to the project's
GitHub repository.
- Late projects may be reassigned, under consultation between lab faculty advisors.
- An internal review should generally precede journal or conference submission.
- Be open and forthright about your expectations. Do not hesitate to bring up any issues that
may arise with the lab's faculty advisors.

## CRedIT

> CRediT is a high-level taxonomy, including 14 roles, that can be used to represent the roles
typically played by contributors to scientific scholarly output. The roles describe each
contributor’s specific contribution to the scholarly output.<sup>5</sup>

The [Training Data Lab][002] at Leiden University, Netherlands, provides a concise graphical
representation of the labels as follows:
