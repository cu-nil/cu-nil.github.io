What is digital in digital ethnography? Setting aside the long and over-theorized history of
ethnography as method, this note advances a deliberately partial and pragmatic account of doing
ethnographic work online. Our approach combines qualitative and quantitative techniques while
extending observational fieldwork beyond interaction and representation to include media,
software, and platform analysis as first-order objects of inquiry.

## Ethnography

To think clearly about ethnography online, it helps to be explicit about what ethnographic
fieldwork ordinarily demands. For our purposes, ethnography organizes itself around at least
three complementary imperatives under the umbrella of fieldwork: to observe, describe, and
participate.

These do not unfold sequentially. They operate as co-present demands, each shaping how the
others proceed. Observation calls for attention, curiosity, patience, and an eye for detail.
Description introduces judgment—questions of interpretation, selection, and even literary
form. No matter how thick the description, it cannot capture the fullness of experience. An
ethnographer’s gaze remains bounded by position and point of view. And yet, especially in the
early stages of fieldwork, I often do not know what I am looking for. Details that later appear
incidental or superfluous often enter the record without their significance yet being clear
(Malinowski 1922; Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw 1995).

Description thus both exceeds and falls short of experience. It overwrites and underwrites
at the same time, unfolding within a tension between what comes into view and what remains
illegible, between what I notice and what only later coheres. Moving through familiar
territory, smoothed and rendered invisible by repetition, I place myself deliberately in the
position of a visitor—pretending to see things again for the first time, restoring a sense of
friction and detail necessary for later analysis.

Never definitive, ethnography records a singular encounter, awash in collective experience.
This balancing act between subject and object demands participation. The observer cannot detach
cleanly from what comes into view. To learn something about others requires stepping outside
oneself; doing so entails exposure, complicity, and vulnerability. The line between subject and
object blurs, but leaning too far to either side produces distortion. Complete identification
courts hubris; claims of scientific detachment collapse under scrutiny (Clifford 1986; Marcus
1995). Ethnographic observation proceeds in the tension between these positions, sustained
rather than resolved.


## Ethnography online

Digital environments do not eliminate the imperatives of fieldwork; they redistribute them.
Crucially, ethnographic practice no longer coheres around a shared material setting. The
observed surface conditions online increasingly fall beyond reach, into media systems, software
architectures, and platform infrastructures. Surface appearances may differ significantly
from the conditions that make them possible, particularly under conditions of unequal access,
platform opacity, and methodological constraint (Hargittai 2020).

Online, observation rarely coincides with co-presence. Interfaces format what comes into
view, platforms filter it, and computational systems constrain it in ways that remain largely
inaccessible to both participants and observers. Participation likewise unfolds through
accounts, avatars, metrics, and traces, often detached from the bodies that generate them and
governed by rules enforced in code rather than articulated in practice. Description, in turn,
confronts a field in which much of what structures social life operates below the threshold
of perception. To describe online social life critically requires moving fieldwork beyond
screen appearances to include the media, software, and platforms that actively delimit the
possibilities of action, interaction, and meaning.

In physical settings, the material properties of a specific place delimit the scope of
ethnographic description. Consider a stadium sport. A football match unfolds within visible and
shared constraints: the field, bodies in motion, and the published rules of the game. When that
same game is played digitally, those constraints no longer coincide in the same way.

The field persists as an image on screen, while its material instantiation—hardware, storage,
and networked infrastructure—recedes from view. The body appears as a controllable avatar,
governed by the physics of the game engine rather than the capacities of the player’s own body.
What the avatar can do follows one set of constraints; what the player’s body can do follows
another, shaped by interfaces, ergonomics, latency, and physical circumstance. Though the rules
of the game remain legible, they now operate twice: once as an explicit system of play, and
again as software code that enforces, supplements, and occasionally overrides them in ways
opaque to both players and observers.

In digital play, what appears unified in action no longer arrives as a single analytic object..
Representation and constraint diverge, and the material conditions that organize action recede.
from immediate observation The difficulty posed by this example is not that digital play      .
lacks materiality, but that its material conditions no longer arrive together with their      .
representations. The apparent unity of action must therefore be analytically delaminated if   .
it is to be described at all. The task of digital ethnography is not simply to notice this    .
separation, but to develop methods capable of tracing it                                      .

At the level of representation, the digital football match presents itself at the surface:
the camera angle, the movements of avatars, the scoreboard, the timing of actions and
outcomes. Here, ethnographic practice remains closest to its familiar form. Description,
close observation, and comparison still apply, drawing on long-standing traditions that treat
representation as both a site of meaning and a problem of mediation (Geertz 1973; Emerson,
Fretz, and Shaw 1995; Clifford 1986).

At the same time, representation in digital environments arrives already structured as data
(Shaw and Hill 2014, 2018). This condition invites the augmentation of description through
computational analysis, not as a replacement for ethnographic judgment but as a means of
extending it across scale and repetition (Yi Tenen 2017). Screen captures, replay files,
logs, and interaction traces can be collected and compared systematically, allowing patterns
to surface that remain invisible in isolated observation. Computational methods thus support
ethnographic description by testing intuitions, surfacing regularities, and situating local
observations within broader distributions of play.

In practice, this may involve recording multiple matches, annotating moments of play, and
comparing how similar situations unfold across players, teams, or difficulty settings.
Screen captures, replay files, logs, and interaction traces can be collected at scale,
allowing patterns to emerge that remain invisible in isolated observation—for example,
recurring formations of play, timing asymmetries between players, or systematic differences
in outcomes tied to camera perspective or interface feedback. Computational methods do not
replace description; they extend it, enabling the ethnographer to test intuitions, surface
regularities, and situate local observations within broader distributions of play.

Moving beyond representation changes what counts as method as well as focus. The media systems
that structure play—interfaces, controller mappings, camera logics, latency, matchmaking,
ranking, and feedback mechanisms—rarely announce themselves in interaction, yet they shape
it continuously. In developing this orientation, we were influenced by work in the Chicago
school, beginning with Robert E. Park’s insistence that urban artifacts become institutional
only insofar as they connect, through use and habit, to the “vital forces” of collective life
(Park 1915). This attention to artifacts as lived infrastructure—tools that acquire social
form through practice rather than design alone—carries forward in later work on infrastructure
as relational, historically contingent, and often visible only at moments of breakdown or
strain (Star and Ruhleder 1996; Bowker and Star 1999; Edwards 2003). At this level, ethnography
therefore draws on tools from platform and software studies, attending to how interfaces,
affordances, and technical systems organize perception, action, and beyond what is visible at
the interface (Larkin 2013; Gillespie 2018).

At this level, researchers might map interface elements and control schemes, documenting
how different camera settings or controller configurations alter play, or comparing how the
same actions register across platforms, game modes, or hardware setups. Researchers might
deliberately vary settings, switch input devices, or repeat identical sequences of play under
controlled conditions to observe how affordances shift. In some cases, this work extends to
reading documentation, patch notes, or developer materials; in others, it requires forensic
reconstruction through experimentation, reverse engineering, or systematic probing of system
behavior. Social dynamics that appear interpersonal at the surface—cooperation, competition,
reputation—often reflect the operation of ranking systems, feedback loops, or network effects
that only become visible through such comparative and iterative analysis.

Regulatory constraints introduce a further methodological challenge. In the digital football
game, enforcement does not occur only through explicit rules of play, but through automated
systems: anti-cheat mechanisms, matchmaking thresholds, penalty regimes, content moderation,
and account governance. These systems shape outcomes unevenly and often opaquely, operating at
a distance from both player intention and situated interaction.

Our approach here was influenced by work that treats regulation not simply as formal law
or stated policy, but as a distributed set of mediating practices that materialize through
technical systems, routines of enforcement, and differential visibility (Clifford 1986;
Rabinow 1977; Lessig 1999; Gillespie 2018). As with infrastructure, regulatory force often
becomes ethnographically visible only in moments of intervention—through warnings, sanctions,
exclusions, or sudden changes in access—rather than through everyday compliance. Attending to
these moments allows ethnography to register how governance operates through code, platforms,
and automated decision-making, even when it remains absent from the screen (Burawoy 1998).

Methodologically, this can involve tracking how identical actions receive different responses
across accounts, matches, or time periods; documenting instances of warning, penalty,
suspension, or exclusion; or comparing player experiences before and after rule changes or
platform updates. Researchers might collect and analyze policy documents, community guidelines,
patch notes, and enforcement notifications, while also attending to their practical effects
as they register in play. Patterns of reward, restriction, or suppression often become
visible only through longitudinal observation and comparison—by following accounts over time,
contrasting sanctioned and unsanctioned behavior, or tracing how reputational and ranking
systems modulate access and visibility. Regulation rarely appears directly on screen, but its
effects accumulate, shaping who can play, under what conditions, and which forms of action
remain viable.’

## Case Study: Library Genesis

The layered approach outlined above emerges directly from our own ethnographic work. In what
follows, we briefly revisit a concrete case study drawn from earlier research on Library
Genesis, one of the largest “shadow libraries” in the world, to show how digital ethnography in
practice already requires movement across representation, media, and regulation.

Library Genesis (often abbreviated as Libgen) is a distributed digital library that aggregates
and preserves millions of scholarly books and articles outside formal publishing and library
infrastructures. Rather than treating the project as a site of piracy alone, our study
approached it ethnographically—as a sociotechnical system composed of people, texts, software,
and governance mechanisms, oriented less toward mass distribution than toward long-term
preservation of knowledge (Yi Tenen and Foxman 2014). The analysis combined close qualitative
observation with computational and infrastructural methods, making it a useful illustration of
the approach sketched here.

At the level of representation, the study began with what was immediately visible: catalog
records, metadata fields, file formats, interfaces for search and download, and traces of user
interaction. We collected and analyzed bibliographic metadata at scale, examining patterns of
duplication, classification, and absorption across collections. Computational analysis made it
possible to identify how texts circulated, how collections grew, and how “canonical” packages
emerged over time—patterns that could not be inferred from isolated observation alone.

Moving beyond representation required attention to media systems and software architecture.
The organization of Libgen depended on specific technical choices: hashing schemes for
de-duplication, database structures for indexing, forum software for coordination, and
BitTorrent-based distribution for redundancy and resilience. Understanding how the library
functioned meant reading documentation, examining code paths where possible, reconstructing
workflows through forum archives, and tracing how infrastructural decisions shaped
participation, authority, and access. What appeared as a single library interface in fact
rested on a layered media ecology that structured what contributors could do and how the
archive could survive.

Finally, the study confronted overlapping regimes of regulation. Library Genesis operated
under community rules governing contribution, curation, and quality control, alongside
corporate enforcement by publishers and state-level legal pressure that periodically reshaped
the system’s visibility and topology. These regulatory forces rarely appeared directly in
everyday use, yet their effects accumulated over time—through takedowns, migrations, mirroring
strategies, and shifts in governance. Tracing these dynamics required longitudinal observation,
comparison across versions of the system, and attention to enforcement events as ethnographic
data rather than external context.

Taken together, the Libgen case illustrates how digital ethnography proceeds in practice: by
moving deliberately across surface representation, mediating infrastructures, and regulatory
constraints, and by augmenting participant observation with computational analysis, platform
study, and infrastructural inquiry. Surface representations never exhaust the field. The task
of digital ethnography lies in assembling descriptions thick enough to register the conditions
that make such appearances possible.
