How does one approach a video game as a critical object of analysis?

In relation to legacy media such as literature and film, methods for reading video games as
objects have been hugely under-theorized. Let's explore this question through a group close
reading of the prologue of *Nier: Automata (2017)*, a critically acclaimed title developed by
Square Enix title.

Together, we'll produce a commentary on the game and reflect on what it means to "close read"
or "annotate" a video game as such. Students interested in the study of digital games are
encouraged to attend.

Pizza will be provided! Please send an email to Julia Walton (jmw2300@columbia.edu) to let us
know you are coming.
