The [*Vsesvit* Digital Archive](https://vsesvit.vercel.app/) is a comprehensive digital bibliography preserving the legacy
of Ukraine's foremost journal of translated world literature. Since its founding in 1925,
*Vsesvit* has served as a vital cultural bridge, introducing Ukrainian readers to literary
voices from around the globe. This project showcases nearly a century of literary exchange
and cultural diplomacy. The archive provides detailed metadata on translated works, including
author names, source countries, translators, and publication dates.

Our archive offers powerful research tools such as advanced search, interactive visualizations,
and network analysis. Users can explore geographical and chronological trends in literary
translation. With over 5,000 translated works from 120+ countries, the database reflects
the journal’s extraordinary international scope. Currently, the dataset includes entries
exclusively from the "New Literature" section of the journal, representing a specific editorial
focus on contemporary foreign works. Work is actively underway to expand the archive to
include additional sections, offering an even broader view of Ukraine’s literary engagement.
Ultimately, the *Vsesvit* Digital Archive illuminates Ukraine's rich tradition of engaging
with world literature.

The dataset is based on: Mykytenko, Oleg, Halina Hamaliy. "Review of World Literature 'Vsesvit'
(The World) in XX century (1925-2000)." *Bibliographic Index to Publications*. Kyiv, 2004.
