In 1995, Newt Gingrich's team circulated a memo, containing a list of words to be used for
Republican messaging. These included terms like "common sense, family, pride, and freedom."
Gingrich later described his goal as nothing less than “reshaping the entire nation through the
news media” (New York Times, 12/14/94). Historians agree these terms had an impact. But to what
extent and how? To answer that question, we propose to treat the memo as a natural experiment
in "keyword injection." We then analyze the congressional record to capture the dynamics of
term diffusion, revealing a pattern of influence over time.
