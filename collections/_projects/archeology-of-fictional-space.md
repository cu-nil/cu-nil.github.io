In this paper, I propose to reconsider theories of diegetic space which rely on
explicit framing (i.e. "two people walk into a room" or "in Spain"). Rather
than looking for maps, I define space in terms of grammatical categories
denoting objects. The emphasis on objects leads to a method for literary
archaeology, informed by cognitive theory and anthropology.

If the universe is made of atoms, a fictional world is also made up of atomic relationships
that form basic, stable configurations, or, what I call, *narratological primitives.* I
construct several such basic spatial buildings blocks here---*diegetic density* and *clutter
distance*. Their application to a well-explored body of Victorian novels challenges several
long standing historical intuitions related to the development of material culture in the
nineteenth century.
